## Desc
- Crossplatform merge app<br/>
(copy the Araxis Merge as similar as possible with the features that I frequently use)
- Why I make this?<br/>
Araxis Merge's copy item to other folder fn and the convenience of UX are irreplaceable. but <b>commercial</b>.
- Why I'm not use react?<br/>
I think state management creates unnecessary thinking.

## Run
```bash
npm i
npm run start
```
